.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mpg123
reads
.I file\^
(or standard input if an empty string \*(lq\*(rq is specified)
and plays it on the audio device.
.I file\^
is assumed to be an MPEG-1 audio bit stream.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t
Test mode.  The audio stream is decoded, but no output occurs.
.TP
.B \-s
The decoded audio samples are written to standard output,
instead of playing them through the audio device.
.TP
.B \-c
Check for filter range violations and report them when decoding
is finished.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose.  Displays the frame numbers during decoding.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.
.TP
.BI \-n " num"
Decode only
.I num
frames.  By default the complete stream is decoded.
.TP
.BI \-skip " num"
Skip first
.I num
frames.  By default the decoding starts at the first frame.
.TP
.BI \-f " factor"
Change scale factor (default: 32768).
.TP
.BI \-r " rate"
Set sample rate (default: automatic).
.TP
.BI \-g " gain"
Set audio hardware output gain (default: don't change).
.TP
.B \-os
Direct audio output to the speaker.
.TP
.B \-oh
Direct audio output to the headphone connector.
.TP
.B \-ol
Direct audio output to the line-out connector.
.TP
.BR \-single0 ", " \-single1
Decode only channel 0 (left) or channel 1 (right),
respectively.  These options are available for
stereo MPEG streams only.
.TP
.B \-singlemix
Mix both channels.  This option is available for
stereo MPEG layer-3 streams only.  It takes less
CPU time than full stereo decoding.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I file
The path name of the input file.  It must be a valid
MPEG-1 audio layer-1, -2 or -3 bit stream.
If
.I file
is \*(lq\*(rq (empty string), mp123
will read from the standard input.  This makes it
possible to use
.BR cat (1)
to concatenate several MPEG streams and pipe them
into
.BR mpg123 .
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR cat (1),
.BR sox (1),
.BR intro (1)
.SH NOTES
MPEG audio decoding requires a good deal of CPU performance,
especially layer-3.  To decode it in realtime, you should
have at least a Pentium, Alpha, SuperSparc or equivalent
processor.  You can also use the
.B -singlemix
option to decode mono only, which reduces the CPU load
somewhat for layer-3 streams.
.P
If everything else fails, use the
.B \-s
option to decode to standard output, direct it into a file
and then use an appropriate utility to play that file.
You might have to use a tool such as
.BR sox (1)
to convert the output to an audio format suitable for
your audio player.
.P
Also note that
.B mpg123
always generates 16 bit stereo data (if one of the
.BR \-single *
options is used, two identical stereo channels are
generated).  If your hardware requires some other
format, for example 8 bit mono, you also have
to use a converter such as
.BR sox (1).
.SH BUGS
Only MPEG-1 streams are supported at this time.
Free format streams are not supported.
Layer-1 support is not heavily tested.
No CRC error checking is performed.
There is currently no support for audio hardware on
DEC Digital Unix, therefore the
.B -s
option has to be used on that platform.

TODO:

A few notes on how mpg123 tries to select a 'good' 
audio encoding and frequency. (not yet implemented!!)

- mpg123 tries to set the settings you specify on the command line
  in the order of its appearence (exclusiv .. no fallback then)

- after this, mpg123 tries to set 
    1. the number of channels (or fallback to mono if stereo isn't possible)
    2. the audioformat to 16 bit (or fallback to 8bit)
    3. the "best" frequency: (in this order)
        - the exact stream frequency or fallback to
        - 2:1 frequency or fallback to
        - 4:1 frequency or try the
        - nearest frequency lower than the frequency of your stream
       mpg123 automagically converts the rate. 

So, if you think (or even know), that your hardware supports a higher
frequency only with eg. mono,8bit you must force mpg123 to play mono 
and 8bit. ("--8bit -m") etc....

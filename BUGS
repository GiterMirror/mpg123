Bug reports, patches:
---------------------
  Please always check the latest version from my home page
  before reporting a bug. 
    (http://www.mpg123.de/)
  If you send me a patch, please use the 'unified' version.
  (diff -u ...)

Of course, there are some known bugs:
-------------------------------------

- Using the buffermode, the switching from foreground to background operation 
  results in ugly noise  (-> hopefully fixed)
- win32 port: problems with option handling
- auto-config depending on audio capabilities not fully (buggy) implemented

- Usually the versions are tested on Solaris and Linux, only. 
  If you encounter a problem for any platform ,please let me know.
  Audio parts are not heavily on some systems.

  It also compiles under Aix 3.x with the 'make generic' version
  SGI completly untested
  SUNOS 4.x completly untested

(1)  Read the README file.

(2)  Type "make" to see a list of supported hardware platforms
     and operating systems, then type the make command that
     best fits your system.

(3)  If compilation was successful, type "make install" to
     install the binary and the manual page in /usr/local.

Have fun!

Some additional remarks:

 - The "linux" and "freebsd" targets provide additional compile
   options beside the "normal" target:

      -int    Uses integer calculations at certain places
              instead of floating point.  This _might_ reduce
              CPU load if the floating point part of your CPU
              is rather slow, e.g. Cyrix/AMD.  Don't use this
              if you have an original intel Pentium or PPro.
              Quality suffers somewhat.

      -2to1   Use 2:1 downsampling.  Faster, but noticeably
              worse quality.

      -4to1   Use 4:1 downsampling.  Yet faster, but ugly
              quality.

   Normally you should try the normal target first, which gives
   you the best possible audio quality.  If your CPU is not
   fast enough for that, and you have a CPU which is known to
   have bad floating point performance, try the -int target.
   Otherwise, try the -2to1 or (as a last resort) -4to1 target,
   which take less CPU power, but also provide worse audio
   quality.  As an alternative, you can try to use the
   "-singlemix" commandline option for mono output, which also
   requires less CPU power.

 - There is currently no direct audio hardware support for the
   "dec", "aix" and "generic" targets.  That means that you
   have to use the "-s" commandline option to write the decoded
   audio data to stdout.

 - On Solaris, use Sun's SparcWorks compiler ("make solaris")
   if at all possible.  It generates faster code than gcc, so
   use gcc only if there's no other way.

(1)  Read the README file.
     (also read the JUKEBOX file if you wanna compile a player for
      the sajber jukebox)

(2)  Type "make" to see a list of supported hardware platforms
     and operating systems, then type the make command that
     best fits your system.

(3)  If compilation was successful, type "make install" to
     install the binary and the manual page in /usr/local.

Have fun!

Some additional remarks:

 - There is currently no direct audio hardware support for the
   "dec", "aix" and "generic" targets.  That means that you
   have to use the "-s" commandline option to write the decoded
   audio data to stdout.

 - On Solaris, use Sun's SparcWorks compiler ("make solaris")
   if at all possible.  It generates faster code than gcc, so
   use gcc only if there's no other way.

 - The macro "htons" causes a compiler warning in httpget.c
   (at least on FreeBSD).  This can be safely ignored.

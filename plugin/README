This is just a simple test I made to understand how
to load dynamic code. Maybe I will do some kind of plugin support
this way.

One general problem is the synchronization with the audio output.
When using a buffer we should call the plugin with the data
(and corresponding frequencies) currently played. 
Then we also need a second (even larger) buffer for the frequency data.
